  ```
  > Tip: Restart your computer for the change to take effect.

### Configure Adobe Acrobat Maximum Resolution Save Settings
The default Adobe Acrobat settings only save PDF documents as images up to 1920 √ó 1080 resolution. To save PDF documents as images (`.jpeg` recommended) with the maximum resolution possible, configure the save settings as follows:
<table><tr><th colspan="2">File Settings</th></tr><tr><td>Grayscale</td><td>JPEG (Quality : Maximum)</td></tr><tr><td>Color</td><td>JPEG (Quality : Maximum)</td></tr><tr><td>Format</td><td>Progressive (5 Scans)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Color Management</th></tr><tr><td>RGB</td><td>Embed profile</td></tr><tr><td>CMYK</td><td>Off</td></tr><tr><td>Grayscale</td><td>Off</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Not applicable</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Conversion</th></tr><tr><td>Colorspace</td><td>Color: RGB</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>819 pixels/inch</td></tr></table>

> Tip: If the save fails, switch the Resolution to 600 pixels/inch first by choosing from the dropdown menu. Then, change it back to the Resolution of 819 pixels/inch by manually typing it.
